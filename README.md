# Hawaii Weather Analysis

SQLAlchemy/Flask-based weather analysis app. This exercise is part of
USC Data Analytics Certificate program.

The exercise consists of two parts:

1. A Jupyter Notebook presenting a general analysis using SQLAlchemy's
ORM cababilities to interface with an SQLite3 database.

2. A Python/Flask App that provides an API to query temperature and
precipitation data as measured in the State of Hawaii between January
2010 and August 2017. The code should be self-explanatory.
